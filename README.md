# Styling a card component with Tailwind CSS

An experiment to determine the effectivness of using Tailwind CSS to style components.

## About this experiment

After several years of learning vanilla CSS and becoming comfortable with the language, I think it’s now beneficial to experiment with popular CSS libraries/frameworks to understand why they are popular and if they would be a good fit in my development workflow.

## What’s Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is an increasingly popular CSS framework. Unlike other CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap), Tailwind aims to be completely unopinionated; meaning it provides a blank slate for the developer to customize, not pre-built components and layouts that are difficult to override. The framework provides extensive utility classes which a developer can use to style an interface without writing a single line of CSS.

### Goals
1. Write no CSS
2. Experiment with building a component with Tailwind utility classes
